## A screenshot of the console output immediately after you have successfully issued a smart contract calls on Layer 2.

## Note 
I have changed the smart contract which I have used for Task 7. It stores the employee of the month data instead the examples in task description. But the example folder which is gw-gitcoin-instruction is same, I just changed the smart contract.
